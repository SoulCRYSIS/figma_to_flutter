I will provide you a link to a Figma frame and brief descriptions, use that to create a screen with these guidelines.

1. **Use MCP tools**
    You should use Figma MCP tools `get_code` and `get_image` for precise reference.
2. **Prefer using design tokens**
    - If code from MCP use token variables, you should do the same
    - All tokens are store inside lib/design_tokens
        - To reduce time using to grep variables, just assume variables exist then fix them later
        - Usage examples
            - Colors: `Figma.colorModes.colorsBackgroundBgActive`
            - Typography (fontSize, fontWeight, etc.): `Figma.typography.fontSizeTextLg.value`
            - Spacing: `Figma.spacing.spacingLg`
            - Border radius: `Figma.radius.radiusSm`
            - Width: `Figma.widths.widthSm`
            - Container (screen padding, max width, etc.): `Figma.containers.containerPaddingMobile`
3. **Prefer reuse widgets**
    - If code from MCP use a reusable widget, you should do the same
    - All reusable widgets are store inside lib/widgets
    - If you cannot find it in there, notice me, maybe I forgot to add
4. **Required Documentation**
    - Figma Reference: Always include the Figma frame URL or node ID
    - Purpose: Brief description of the screen
5. **Follow best practices**
    - Consider widget size and complexity for performance
    - Make it easy to be use or modify later
6. **Handle basic logic**
    - Handle ephemeral state if you can, such as radioGroup, tabIndex, etc.
    - You don't need to handle api connection or anything that you don't have information. Maybe use mock empty function.
7. **Strictly follow design**
    Make sure you use the same padding, color, alignment and everything as the figma
